        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
        A year ago I became interested in level design for video games
        when I started playing with the map editor included in one of my favorite games.
        Designing 3d environments is a fun and rewarding hobby that is not limited to games.
        Recently with online events gaining popularity, designing virtual spaces for platforms
        like altspaceVR, VRchat, or even Minecraft has become an important means of helping people
        feel more connected and embodied remotely.
